# Firmware for Nathan's hacked Kinesis advantage keyboard

I used a Teensy 2++ to create my own controller for this keyboard.  I stuffed it into a 40 pin DIP socket and rewired a couple of the pins.

My wiring is probably different than anyone else's.  I did the project before finding this firmware or corresponding resources.  Maybe I'll post the schematic sometime.  I reverse engineered most of the keyboard circuitry.

## Keymaps
Note that I don't use many of the keys, but I think I made provisions to use them if you wish.
